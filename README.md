These sites use enticing offers to gather your data or force you to perform actions (like completing surveys or downloading apps) that benefit them financially, not you.
Many claim they’ll reveal a "code" after you follow a series of steps, but no legitimate gift cards are provided.
No Such Thing as Free Gift Cards:

Roblox gift cards are sold through verified retailers and Roblox itself. Legitimate free gift cards are only distributed during official promotions by Roblox or trusted partners.
Phishing Attempts:

Sites may ask for your Roblox login credentials or personal information, putting your account and security at risk.
Malware Risk:

Clicking on these links or downloading files from these websites can infect your device with viruses or spyware.
How to Spot and Avoid Scams
Check the URL:

If it doesn’t belong to Roblox or a known retailer (like Amazon, Walmart, etc.), it’s likely fake. The official Roblox website always ends in .roblox.com.
Avoid Completing Surveys or Tasks:

These are designed to make scammers money or steal your information.
Look for Official Promotions:

Roblox announces giveaways or gift card offers on its official website or social media channels.
What to Do If You Encounter Such a Scam
Do Not Enter Any Information:

If a website asks for your Roblox credentials, payment details, or personal information, close it immediately.
Report the Website:

Report the scam to Roblox here or through your browser’s reporting tools.
Educate Others:

Warn friends or family members about these scams, especially younger players who may be more susceptible.
Secure Your Account:

If you’ve interacted with a scam site:
Change your Roblox password immediately.
Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).
Check your account for unauthorized transactions.
How to Get Roblox Gift Cards Safely
Purchase from Trusted Retailers:

Buy gift cards directly from Roblox or authorized sellers like Amazon, Target, or Walmart.
Official Roblox Events:

Occasionally, Roblox may run events where gift cards or Robux are rewarded. These are always announced on their official platforms.
Conclusion
Be vigilant and avoid falling for "free Roblox gift card" scams. They are designed to exploit your curiosity or desire for free rewards. The safest way to enjoy Roblox is to stick to official channels and verified offers.
